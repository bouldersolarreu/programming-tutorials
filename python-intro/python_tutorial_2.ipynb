    "# Python Tutorial Part II: Data Types\n",

    "## Wendy and Allison\n",
    "\n",
    "In the other notebook, we had our first look at Python and Jupyter notebooks. So far, we've only used Python to manipulate numbers.  There's a lot more to life than numbers, so Python lets us represent many other types of data in programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll learn how to:\n",
    "* represent and manipulate another fundamental type of data: text.  A piece of text is called a *string* in Python.\n",
    "* invoke *methods*.  A method is very similar to a function.  It just looks a little different because it's tied to a particular piece of data (like a piece of text or a number).\n",
    "* work with datasets in Python -- *collections* of data, like the numbers 2 through 5 or the words \"welcome\", \"to\", and \"boulder\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We principally use two kinds of collections:\n",
    "  * **Arrays:** An array is a collection of many pieces of a single kind of data, kept in order.  An array is like a single column in an Excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "  * **Tables:** A table is a collection of many pieces of different kinds of data.  It's like an entire Excel spreadsheet.  Each row of a table represents one entity, and each column contains a different kind of data about each entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week is about arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to add cells at any point to aid you in any calculations!\n",

    "# 1. Review: The building blocks of Python code\n",
    "The two building blocks of Python code are *expressions* and *statements*.  An expression is a piece of code that\n",
    "\n",
    "* is self-contained, meaning it would make sense to write it on a line by itself, and\n",
    "* usually has a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some expressions, with values `3`, `-1`, `1`, and `32`, respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "    3\n",
    "    2 - 3\n",
    "    abs(2 - 3)\n",
    "    max(3, pow(2, abs(2 - 3) + pow(2, 2)))\n",
    "\n",
    "All these expressions but the first are *compound expressions*, meaning that they are actually combinations of several smaller expressions.  `2 + 3` combines the expressions `2` and `3` by addition.  In that example, `2` and `3` are called *subexpressions* because they're expressions that are part of a larger expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *statement* is a whole line of code.  Some statements are just expressions.  The expressions listed above are examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other statements *make something happen* rather than *having a value*.  After they are run, something in the world has changed.  For example, an assignment statement assigns a value to a name.  Here are some assignment statements:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    height = 1.3\n",
    "    the_number_five = abs(-5)\n",
    "    absolute_height_difference = abs(height - 1.688)\n",
    "\n",
    "A key idea in programming is that large, interesting things can be built by combining many simple, uninteresting things.  The key to understanding a complicated piece of code is breaking it down into its simple components.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a lot is going on in the last statement above, but it's really just a combination of a few things.  This picture describes what's going on.\n",

    "In short, arrays store data more efficiently and we can perform arithmetic operations such as \"divide all elements in the array by 3\" on arrays, but not on lists. Additionally, it is generally considered bad practice for arrays to change size because of the way they are stored in memory, so we should know the size of an array before we initialize it. For example, we can initialize arrays using functions like `np.zeros()` or `np.ones()`. We will explore this more later.\n",
